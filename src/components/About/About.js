            Hi! I'm Shahalam Sharif. I am a tech enthusiast boy. I began my
            journey in 2017 to become a self-taught web developer. I tried a lot
            of things at different places to become a Web Developer such as
            Udemy, YouTube, FreeCodeCapm, etc. Every time I field badly. Along
            my journey, I realized one thing that is I need to follow a strict
            routine because I was distracted easily. One day I found a video on
            YouTube posted by Jankanr Mahbub Bhai. In that video, he launched a
            course on the Programming Hero platform. I researched a bit and I
            found that that is the course I was looking for. So I enrolled
            immediately. Now I wish, I would become a Web Developer Inshaallah.
            Finally!
