                What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
              </h3>
              <p className="fs-5 mt-3 lead">
                <strong>Authentication:</strong> Authentication verifies who the
                user is. Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins,
                biometric information, and other information provided or entered
                by the user. Authentication is the first step of a good identity
                and access management process. Authentication is visible to and
                partially changeable by the user. <br />
                <strong>Authorization:</strong> Authorization determines what
                resources a user can access. Authorization works through
                settings that are implemented and maintained by the
                organization. Authorization always takes place after
                authentication. Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by
                the user.

                Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
                implement authentication?

                I'm using Firebase mainly for authentication. Firebase has other
                services too. Firebase handles authentication seamlessly and
                securely. There are other companies that provide services like
                Firebase they are Supabase, OAuth, etc.

              <p className="fs-5 mt-3 lead">
                Firebase provides several services apart from authentication.
                These are Database, Real Database, Storage, Hosting, Cloud
                Function, ML, etc.
